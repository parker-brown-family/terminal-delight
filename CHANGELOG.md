## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-14

First public, source-only release. A GPU-native Linux terminal (Rust + gpui +
`alacritty_terminal`) with a hot-reloadable, CRT-flavored visual identity.

### Added

- **Real terminal core.** PTY + full VT emulation (bash, vim, top, tmux
  verified); live resize → SIGWINCH; full ANSI colour (16 themed + 256 +
  truecolor), bold/underline/inverse/dim; scrollback, mouse selection, copy/paste
  with bracketed paste.
- **Tiling multi-pane.** True tiling-tree splits (`ctrl+alt+r` / `ctrl+alt+d`)
  that divide only the focused pane, tab strip, `alt+←/→` focus movement, sub-tab
  drag-to-split/move, and a pop-out scratch window with sub-tab tear-off.
- **Hot-reloadable themes.** Four built-ins (`quiet-command`, `field-command`,
  `tactical-overdrive`, `hacker`) plus a live-editable `custom` slot read from
  `~/.config/terminal-delight/theme.toml` and reloaded on save (~300 ms). Theme
  picker with per-glyph captions and 1.5 s hover tooltips; the custom slot's
  tooltip shows its resolved path and an "Open in editor" action.
- **Per-pane appearance.** A pane's look splits into two independently-inheriting
  groups — the theme group (theme/seed/colour-mode/syntax) and the monitor-OSD
  grade group — each with a live, non-destructive "follow outer" toggle.
- **Monitor-OSD grading.** A display tray (global or per-pane) with
  brightness / contrast / colour / text / background / gamma, applied in HSLA at
  paint time, **plus a text-size channel** that rides the same inherit/override
  scope.
- **Seed colour wheel** for retinting a theme from a single accent colour.
- **CRT-lite effects** — scanlines, vignette, glow, and a per-pane barrel warp
  via the vendored `td-crt-pass` gpui renderer patch — all per-theme dials.
- **Desktop integration.** `scripts/install-hotkey.sh` registers
  `Ctrl+Alt+T` on GNOME to launch the app (reversible with `--uninstall`).

### Project / packaging

- MIT-licensed own source; binaries are **not** MIT-distributable because the
  vendored Zed/gpui graph links GPL-3.0 crates — see
  [`THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`](THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md). This is a **source-only**
  release.
- CI gate: fmt + clippy (`-D warnings`) + tests + release build + `cargo-deny`
  (licenses/bans/advisories/sources) + browser-prototype checks.
- Contributor docs: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), issue/PR templates,
  [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md), [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Platform

- Linux only (X11 & Wayland via gpui's wgpu renderer). Not macOS/Windows.
