//! THE WORKBENCH — a pane's second face.
//!
//! Every pane in this window has always been one thing: a view of a terminal.
//! This gives it a second face, toggled from its own header, showing the same
//! agent's *work* instead of the same agent's *typing*.
//!
//! ```text
//!   ┌── pane ────────────────────────────────────────┐
//!   │ ▸ claude   [ TERMINAL │ WORKBENCH ]      ⋯  ×  │  ← the toggle, per pane
//!   ├────────────────────────────────────┬───────────┤
//!   │                                    │ artifacts │  ← the rail's shelves
//!   │   the selected work object,        │ decisions │
//!   │   rendered natively                │ other     │
//!   │                                    ├───────────┤
//!   │                                    │ ▸ Spine   │  ← colour-coded history
//!   │                                    │ ▸ Pipeline│
//!   └────────────────────────────────────┴───────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! Both halves are in the pane, which is the decision worth defending. The
//! attention spine on the window's right edge answers *which pane wants me*;
//! this answers *what did this agent make*, and those are different questions
//! asked at different moments. Putting the second one in the window's chrome
//! would make a fleet of twenty agents share one rail, and a rail that mixes
//! twenty conversations is a feed. Inside the pane it also inherits the pane's
//! curvature, its skin and its palette for free — the tube bends the workbench
//! exactly as much as it bends the terminal, because the pixel pass does not
//! know or care which face is underneath it.
//!
//! # Nothing here knows about gpui
//!
//! State transitions, shelf membership, selection, what fits at a given width
//! and which button does what are all decided by pure functions over plain
//! data, in the shape [`crate::tree`] and [`crate::slot`] established: a rule
//! that lives in a render closure can only be tested by photographing it.
//!
//! # Embodiment is ours, not the agent's
//!
//! The agent says what a thing *is*. How much of it can be shown at this size,
//! in this pane, right now, is this window's decision — see [`Embodiment`].
//! The same `architecture` surface is a full interactive drawing in a wide
//! pane, a node list in a narrow one, and one line in a pane nobody is looking
//! at. That is the whole reason the protocol carries meaning rather than
//! layout.
